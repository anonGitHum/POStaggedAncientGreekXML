# POS-tagged AncientGreek texts

This repository contains the POS-tagged (CTSized) texts of the Ancient Greek Literature contained in the two repositories:

* https://github.com/PerseusDL/canonical-greekLit
* https://github.com/OpenGreekAndLatin/First1KGreek

Those texts have been first tokenized:

* https://github.com/gcelano/CTSAncientGreekXML

Relying on this tokenization, the POS-tagging has been generated (completely) automatically by using the MATE tagger, which has been trained on Perseus treebank data:

* https://perseusdl.github.io/treebank_data/

The tagger achieved an accuracy of 88%. More details can be found in the article:
